# VK_Flic
Simple Flic theory calculations. No near-field effect!

This LabView program calculates the simplified optical theory for FLIC (fluorescence interference contrast) microscopy based on the theory in 
Lambacher, A. & Fromherz, P. Luminescence of dye moleculars on oxidized
silicon and fluorescence interference contrast (FLIC) microscopy of
biomembranes. J. Opt. Soc. Am. B 19, 1435â€“1453 (2002).

without near-field lifetime correction.

Start the flic1_0 vi in flic.llb in the Flic folder.
Define a layer system.
Load the appropriate data for excitation, emission, camera sensitivity.
Set aperture, integration steps, dipole orientation and desired distance range.
